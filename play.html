        LUKE. Couldn't you pick a fight?

        REVENUE. I'm coming to that. You know up North they believe that a man
        can be killed in the South for calling another man a liar.
        
        LUKE. That's right.
        
        REVENUE. It is, is it? Well, I've called men liars from Washington to
        Atlanta, and I'm here to tell you about it.
        
        LUKE. They must a took pity on ye.
        
        REVENUE. Do you know Two Gun Jake that keeps the dive down in Henderson?
        
        LUKE. I should think I do.... Jake's killed enough of 'em.
